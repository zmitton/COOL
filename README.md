# [Coursera] Compilers by Alex Aiken (Stanford University)

## Notes and Code from self-study of the online course


### Steps and Blockers

The first issue is finding the lecture videos, which are no longer available on coursera. After extensive searching, I found the entire playlist on the internet archive [here](https://archive.org/details/academictorrents_e31e54905c7b2669c81fe164de2859be4697013a/lectures/002-the-cool-programming-language/Compilers). 

Next I had trouble downloading SPIM, a MIPS assembly simulator (basically I guess a virtual machine). First I accidentally got the GUI version, but later downloaded a command line usable version for mac with `brew install SPIM`

To run a file rather then jumping into the interactive version I had to use `spim -file spim_hello_world.s`.
